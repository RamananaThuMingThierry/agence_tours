                                    Hello, my name is <strong>MILASOA Ricki Cardo</strong>, from Antalaha, Madagascar, and now based in Antananarivo. I have worked in tourism since 2015 and became a professional tour guide in 2017. I am fluent in Malagasy, French, English and speak some German. With years of experience guiding tours across Madagascar, I’ve worked with travelers from many countries, including Germany, Russia, Italy, the USA, Australia, China, Japan, South Africa, Morocco, and France.
                                </p>

                                    We create experiences blending nature, culture, history, and Madagascar’s biodiversity. We also provide translation and organize tailored evening activities. In 2024, we started a tour company, collaborating with drivers, guides, and a marketing manager to deliver top-quality service. Our goal is to offer journeys through Madagascar that feel like exploring with a friend. Contact me to discover Madagascar!
